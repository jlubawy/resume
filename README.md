## Professional Experience

__Awarepoint__, Senior Firmware Engineer (June 2015 - June 2018)

* One of a three-person firmware team responsible for developing the company's first generation of BLE/Wi-Fi location tracking products, of which we successfully sold tens of thousands of units with no major production issues.
* Worked extensively with the TI MSP430 (low-power application), CC26XX (BLE), and CC31XX (Wi-Fi) family of chips.
* Successfully led a design effort to create a second generation of products in which we ported the firmware from a three-chip platform (MSP+CC26XX+CC31XX) to a two-chip platform (CC26XX+CC31XX), reducing overall product cost and dimensions. This required a significant effort to reduce firmware memory consumption, while keeping the same functionality.
* Was responsible for the development of the products' accelerometer drivers.
* Was responsible for the development and maintenance of the firmware build/test tools that we used during development. These tools were written in Python, Go, and Java.
* Helped develop and maintain various Android applications used in production and during debugging.

__Western Digital__, Senior Electronics Subsystem Engineer (July 2012 - June 2015)

* Provided internal applications support for a wide range of client and enterprise hard-disk controller (HDC) programs.
* Worked closely with ASIC designers to debug proprietary HDC logic during design and bring-up.
* Extensive experience debugging hardware and firmware caused memory/cache corruption issues that are only seen during high-volume production.
* Led debug efforts involving the HDC's security and encryption subsystem.

__Western Digital__, Test Engineer (July 2011 - July 2012)

* Developed and managed firmware test plans for multiple disk drive programs that eventually went into high-volume production, including the first 2TB 2.5" disk-drive and the first 6TB WD Red drive for network-attached storage.

## Side-Projects

* I have made contributions to various open-source projects such as OpenCV ([#6283](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/6283)) and jSerialComm ([#62](https://github.com/Fazecast/jSerialComm/pull/62), [#99](https://github.com/Fazecast/jSerialComm/pull/99)).
* My [port](https://github.com/jlubawy/go-boilerpipe) of the Java Boilerpipe library to the Go language currently has about 50 stars on GitHub. This library is used to extract the content of an article given an HTML web page.
* For my bachelor degree senior design project, we developed a vehicle parking monitoring system which utilized a custom designed magnetic sensor board that would detect vehicles in a parking space, and broadcast its status using ZigBee and Wi-Fi, displaying the status on a web page.
* I have experience using web APIs such as Facebook, Google Maps, and Spotify for various other side-projects.
